"""Concept: Compacted State + Session State (Section 6 of the spec).

Two distinct schemas live here, and the distinction *is* the teaching point:

- `CompactedTicketInfo` is small, structured, and cheap to pass around. It's
  what routing, agents, and tools actually consume.
- `SessionState` is the full LangGraph graph state. It carries the raw
  conversation history (needed for the LLM nodes to reason over) *and* the
  compacted info (needed for everything downstream of routing). Nothing
  downstream of the Context Compaction node should need to re-read
  `conversation_history` — if you find yourself doing that, the compaction
  step isn't doing its job.
