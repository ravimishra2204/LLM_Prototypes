Every path through this graph ends at END within one `invoke()` call —
including the "refund needs approval" path. There is no `interrupt()` /
pause-and-resume anywhere in this module: "pending approval" is represented
purely as a PendingApproval record in session_store, a state *value*, not a
suspended graph. Resuming that story later is a completely separate graph
(pipeline/approval_graph.py), invoked independently from the Approver View.
